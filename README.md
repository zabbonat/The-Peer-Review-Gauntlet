## 🎮 About

You are a young researcher. You spent 18 months writing the perfect paper. The data is solid. The methodology is robust. The conclusions are... *modest but relevant*.

Now your Manuscript must traverse the dreaded **Gauntlet** — a perilous path from Submission to Acceptance, through territories infested by hostile academic creatures.

**Survive the reviewers. Reach acceptance. Publish or perish.**

## 👹 The Enemies

| Enemy | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🚪 **Desk Rejection** | "Out of scope!" — Instant threat at submission |
| 😇 **Reviewer 1** | The rare benevolent one. "Minor typo on page 3" |
| 💀 **REVIEWER 2** | The destroyer. "Major revisions needed", "This is not novel", "Why didn't you use [completely different method]?" |
| 👻 **Reviewer 3** | "..." — Never responds. Ever. |
| 🪞 **Self-Citer** | "Please cite: Me (2008), Me (2011), Me (2015), Me (2019)..." |
| 🐙 **Scope Creeper** | "Have you considered also analyzing [entirely different research question]?" |
| ⚖️ **Editor-in-Chief** | "After careful consideration..." |
